Validate the app
Check the AppDisplayName and AppId in the alert.
Confirm whether the application is sanctioned by IT/security or if itâ€™s unknown.
Look up the publisher/registration details to confirm legitimacy.
Review the permissions
Identify which delegated or application permissions were requested.
Flag immediately if sensitive scopes are present (Mail.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, offline_access, etc.).
Check user consent activity
Identify the list of ConsentedUsers.
Review whether these are high-value or privileged accounts (admins, executives, finance, IT).
Investigate sign-ins linked to the app
Query SigninLogs for activity associated with the suspicious AppId.
Look for unusual IP addresses, geographies, or impossible travel.
Correlate sign-ins with time of consent to detect attacker follow-up.
Scope potential impact
Review mailbox or file activity by the consenting accounts.
Look for spikes in access, downloads, or forwarding rules.
Contain & mitigate
If malicious: disable the OAuth app (Set-AzureADServicePrincipal -AccountEnabled $false).
Revoke tokens and reset passwords for impacted users.
Consider conditional access or app consent policies to prevent recurrence
