name: "DLL Sideloading Detection (Windows)"
description: |
  Detects potential DLL sideloading activity where high-value processes
  (e.g., Teams, OneDrive, svchost, rundll32) load DLLs from unusual or
  non-standard directories outside of core system or Program Files paths. 
  This technique is commonly abused by adversaries to gain execution under
  trusted processes and evade defenses.
