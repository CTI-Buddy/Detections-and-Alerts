triage:
  - Confirm IP reputation (TOR, VPN, hosting providers).
  - Check whether targeted accounts are privileged.
  - Reset passwords or enforce MFA on impacted accounts.
  - Hunt for other activity from the same IP across services.
notes: |
  This rule may fire when red teams or penetration testers run spray campaigns. Tune thresholds (FailedUsers, Attempts) to reduce false positives.
